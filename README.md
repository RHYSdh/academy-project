Final project for TDP

• Why are we doing this?
This is to test knowledge and understanding of topics covered during the academy. I will be able to demonstrate what I have learned during the last 5 weeks.

• How I expected the challenge to go.
I'm expecting to find the challenge straight forward i don't expect to have many issues. I am hoping that i'll be able to build on the requested criteria to make something of my own.

• What went well?
The C# project, no errors or issues getting code to work and functionality added.

• What didn't go as planned?
I thought the Javascript project would be easier than I expected. Note to self, focus on the data and not the DOM when making changes. I got stuck on how to get the table to update when making changes this just involved re-loading the screen after data changes were made.
I still feel my CSS knowledge isn't the best and is an area for me to grow more.

• Possible improvements for future"# academy-project"
None that i can think of.
