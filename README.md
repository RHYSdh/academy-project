Final project for TDP

• Why are we doing this? This is to test knowledge and understanding of topics covered during the academy. I will be able to demonstrate what I have learned during the last 5 weeks.

• How I expected the challenge to go. I'm expecting to find the challenge straight forward i don't expect to have many issues. I am hoping that i'll be able to build on the requested criteria to make something of my own.

• What went well? • What didn't go as planned? • Possible improvements for future"# academy-project"
